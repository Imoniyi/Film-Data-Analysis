# Film-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis on Film Data Using PostgreSQL
# Introduction 
This was a project given to me while taking my data analytics course with Dahel Techies. The goal is for me to apply the SQL skills I have learned throughout the course to perform exploratory data analysis on the "inidata" database, which contains information about films, people, reviews, and roles. The project will focus on retrieving, filtering, and analyzing data to answer real-life business questions related to the film industry.
# Data source
This data was gotten from Datacamp
## Key questions to answer
* What are the top 10 highest-grossing films in the database, and when were they released?
* How many films in the database were released in each country, and what are the top five countries?
* How many films are available in each language, and what are the top three languages represented?
* What is the average IMDb score for films in the database?
* Which country has made the highest profit from movies?
* Which movie made the highest profit in the 21st century?
* How many people in the database are still alive (based on birthdate and death date)?
* Which year has the highest number of movie releases?
* Determine the top 10 people with the most roles in the database.
* Who are the top 10 actors or directors with the most roles in the database?
* Identify how many people in the database are still alive.
* Calculate the average number of user and critic reviews for films.
* Identify films with the highest number of user and critic reviews.
* Which films have the most Facebook likes, and is there a correlation with their IMDb scores?
